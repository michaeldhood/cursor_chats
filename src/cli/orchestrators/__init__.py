"""
CLI orchestrators for complex workflows.

Orchestrators coordinate multiple services to implement complex operations.
They are pure Python (no Click dependencies) and can be tested independently
or called from other interfaces (web UI, scripts, etc.).
"""
# Orchestrators will be imported here as they're created in Phases 3-7
# Example:
# from .ingestion import IngestionOrchestrator
# from .batch import BatchOrchestrator

# PRD: Cursor Chats Knowledge Base

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

- PRD: Cursor Chats Knowledge Base
- Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary

Turn Cursor chat logs into a dynamic knowledge base that helps users capture insights, track project evolution, journal decisions, and maintain context across sessions. The tool will grow from a basic extractor into a robust system with memory retention and optional AI enhancements, sprinkled with humorâ€”like Cursor playfully scolding you for asking the same question repeatedly!

The system extracts knowledge from Cursor chat logs, enabling users to build searchable archives, generate structured journals, and maintain durable context across AI sessions. This addresses the common problem of losing valuable insights and context when switching between Cursor chat sessions.

## 6. Narrative

A developer works with Cursor daily, building up valuable context and insights through their conversations. Instead of losing this knowledge when starting new chat sessions, they use the Cursor Chats system to extract, organize, and search their historical conversations. The system learns their patterns, gently reminds them when they're asking repeated questions, and helps them build a durable knowledge base that grows more valuable over time. Teams can share insights, track project evolution, and maintain collective memory across all their development work.

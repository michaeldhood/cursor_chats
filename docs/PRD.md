## **Product Requirements Document (PRD) for `cursor_chats`**

### **1. Vision and Scope**

**Vision**:  
Turn Cursor chat logs into a dynamic knowledge base that helps users capture insights, track project evolution, journal decisions, and maintain context across sessions. The tool will grow from a basic extractor into a robust system with memory retention and optional AI enhancements, sprinkled with humor—like Cursor playfully scolding you for asking the same question repeatedly!

**Scope**:

- **Phase 1**: Build the core extraction, parsing, and journaling functionality.
- **Phase 2**: Add knowledge extraction and durable context features.
- **Phase 3**: Introduce advanced AI insights, visualizations, and collaboration tools.

### **2. Feature Prioritization and Phased Development**

#### **Phase 1: Foundation (Core Functionality)**

**Objective**: Create a reliable base for extracting, parsing, and journaling chat data.  
**Features**:

1. **Extraction Enhancements**:
   - Customizable output paths and filenames for extracted chats.
   - Performance tweaks (e.g., limit directory search depth).
2. **Improved Parsing**:
   - Robust JSON validation with fallback for malformed data.
   - Basic tagging (manual or regex-based) for organizing chats.
3. **Journaling**:
   - Generate journals using templates (e.g., “What happened?”, “Why?”, “Next steps”).
   - Support manual annotations within chat exports.
4. **CLI Usability**:
   - Batch processing for multiple chat conversions.
   - Logging with adjustable verbosity levels.

**Timeline**: 1-2 months  
**Deliverable**: A stable tool for extracting chats and creating basic journals.

#### **Phase 2: Knowledge Extraction and Memory**

**Objective**: Enable users to extract insights and maintain durable context, with a touch of humor.  
**Features**:

1. **Memory Bank**:
   - Extract key chat excerpts and tag them for reuse in Cursor Rules.
   - Export memories as JSON for easy integration.
2. **Timeline View**:
   - Create a chronological summary of chats per project.
3. **Enhanced Markdown**:
   - Add timestamps, model details, and formatted code blocks to outputs.
4. **Search Functionality**:
   - Index chats for keyword-based searches across projects.
5. **Comical Memory Responses**:
   - If a question repeats (e.g., detected via search), Cursor responds with sass:
     - “Sigh, you asked this yesterday! Make some flashcards or something!”
     - “Again? I’m starting to feel like a broken record here…”

**Timeline**: 2-3 months  
**Deliverable**: A tool that tracks context, supports searches, and adds playful memory nudges.

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Features and Polish**

**Objective**: Elevate the tool with AI insights, visualizations, and team features.  
**Features**:

1. **AI Summarization**:
   - Integrate an AI API to summarize chats and highlight key insights.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Generate chat dependency graphs or knowledge maps.
3. **Collaboration**:
   - Sync chats across teams for multi-user projects.
   - Export polished reports (PDF, HTML).
4. **Enhanced Comical Elements**:
   - Escalate memory humor based on repetition frequency:
     - Day 3: “Seriously, third time’s the charm—write it down!”
     - Day 5: “I’m begging you, let’s move on from this question!”

**Timeline**: 3-4 months  
**Deliverable**: A sophisticated knowledge system with AI and collaboration capabilities.

### **3. Testing Strategy**

Testing is woven into each phase to catch issues early and ensure reliability. Here’s the plan:

- **Unit Testing**:
  - Use `pytest` to test individual functions (e.g., extraction logic, JSON parsing).
  - Example: `test_extract_chats` verifies file output correctness.
- **Integration Testing**:
  - Validate workflows across modules (e.g., extract → parse → journal).
  - Example: Ensure a chat file converts to a tagged Markdown journal.
- **Functional Testing**:
  - Confirm features meet user needs (e.g., search returns relevant results).
- **Manual Testing**:
  - Test CLI usability and output readability with sample chats.
- **Continuous Testing**:
  - Run tests on every commit using CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions).

**Phase-Specific Testing**:

- **Phase 1**: Focus on extraction accuracy and journal formatting.
- **Phase 2**: Add tests for memory tagging, search precision, and comical triggers.
- **Phase 3**: Include AI API mocks, visualization validation, and team sync checks.

### **4. Milestones and Success Criteria**

- **Phase 1**:
  - **Milestone**: Extract chats, generate journals, and tag insights manually.
  - **Success**: Users can convert chats into usable Markdown files.
- **Phase 2**:
  - **Milestone**: Searchable chat archive with memory exports and witty responses.
  - **Success**: Users can query past chats and feed context to Cursor.
- **Phase 3**:
  - **Milestone**: AI summaries, visualizations, and team features deployed.
  - **Success**: Users gain actionable insights and collaborate seamlessly.

---

### **5. Risks and Mitigations**

- **Risk**: AI API costs or downtime.
  - **Mitigation**: Include a local summarization fallback (e.g., using spaCy).
- **Risk**: Slow performance with large chat archives.
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize indexing and limit search scope.
- **Risk**: Users ignore tagging or memory features.
  - **Mitigation**: Offer intuitive defaults and clear guides.

---

### **6. Future Considerations**

- **Mobile Access**: A lightweight app for chat summaries on the go.
- **Voice Commands**: Query or narrate journals via voice.
- **Plugins**: Let users extend features (e.g., custom export formats).

## **Next Steps**

This PRD sets a roadmap from a functional tool to a witty, powerful knowledge system. Based on your current code, Phase 1 builds on existing extraction logic, adding parsing and journaling. The comical memory feature you suggested fits perfectly in Phase 2—imagine Cursor’s exasperated “Flashcards, please!” after your third repeat question!

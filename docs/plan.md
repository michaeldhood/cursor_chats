Here’s a consolidated version of the plan, merging the goals/success criteria from the milestones with the detailed issues into a single, streamlined structure for each project within the "Cursor" team in Linear. This version retains all the essential details—goals, success criteria, and tasks—while making it more compact and ready for import into Linear. The MCP server integration is woven into the workflow as an existing component for task management.

## **MCP Server Integration Workflow**
The existing MCP server will manage task flow between Cursor and Linear:  
- **Task Fetching**: Cursor uses Linear’s API via the MCP server to fetch open issues (e.g., `GET /v1/issues?teamId=CURSOR&state=Todo`).  
- **Task Assignment**: Issues are assigned to Cursor as a bot user in Linear.  
- **Task Completion**: Cursor updates Linear via the MCP server upon completion (e.g., `PUT /v1/issues/CUR-1` with state "Completed").  
- **Automation**: MCP server syncs tasks every 15 minutes, with error handling (e.g., retries on failure).  

**Linear Setup**:  
- Bot User: Create a "Cursor" bot user in Linear.  
- API Key: Provide the MCP server with an API key for authentication.  
- Issue Mapping: Link CUR-1 to CUR-40 to Cursor’s internal tracking.  

---

## **Importing into Linear**
1. **Create Projects**:  
   - Add "Phase 1 - Foundation", "Phase 2 - Knowledge Extraction and Memory", and "Phase 3 - Advanced Features and Polish" as projects under the "Cursor" team.  
2. **Add Milestones**:  
   - Create milestones within each project (e.g., "Extraction Enhancements", "Memory Bank").  
3. **Create Issues**:  
   - Import issues CUR-1 to CUR-40 as tickets under their respective milestones.  
   - **CSV Format**:  
     - Columns: `Title`, `Description`, `Project`, `Milestone`, `Estimate`  
     - Example: `CUR-1, "Update extract_chats to accept user-defined output...", "Phase 1 - Foundation", "Extraction Enhancements", "Medium"`  
   - **API Alternative**: Use Linear’s API to batch-create issues:  
     ```json
     {
       "title": "CUR-1 - Add customizable output paths and filenames",
       "description": "Update extract_chats to accept user-defined output directories and prefixes for JSON files.",
       "teamId": "CURSOR",
       "projectId": "Phase 1 - Foundation",
       "milestoneId": "Extraction Enhancements",
       "estimate": "Medium"
     }
     ```  
4. **Configure Workflow**:  
   - Set states (Todo, In Progress, Done) and assign issues to the Cursor bot via the MCP server.  

---

## **Summary**
This consolidated plan organizes `cursor_chats` into three Linear projects with 12 milestones and 40 issues, merging goals, success criteria, and tasks for clarity. The MCP server integration leverages the existing setup to keep Cursor in sync with Linear, ensuring tasks like "CUR-1" are fetched and completed seamlessly. This structure is primed for import into Linear—let me know if you need a specific CSV file or API script to get it loaded!

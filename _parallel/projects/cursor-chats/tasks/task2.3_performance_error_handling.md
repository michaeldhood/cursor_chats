## Description

Add performance optimization, progress indicators, and robust error handling to the extraction engine.

## Details

- Implement multi-threading or async processing for parallel extraction
- Add progress bars using tqdm or similar for visual feedback
- Create comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios
- Implement retry logic for transient failures (file locks, etc.)
- Add performance monitoring and bottleneck identification
- Create detailed error logging with actionable messages
- Implement graceful degradation for partially corrupted files
- Add resource usage limits (memory, disk space checks)
- Create extraction resume capability for interrupted operations
- Optimize I/O operations with buffering and batch processing

## Test Strategy

- Test parallel processing improves performance without data corruption
- Verify progress indicators accurately reflect extraction status
- Test error handling for various failure scenarios (permissions, corruption, etc.)
- Confirm retry logic handles transient failures appropriately
- Validate performance monitoring identifies actual bottlenecks
- Test graceful degradation extracts partial data from corrupted files
- Verify resource limits prevent system overload
- Test resume capability correctly continues interrupted extractions

## Follow-up Context

**Parent Task:** Task 2 - Chat Extraction Engine
**Trigger:** Task expansion for better manageability
**Relationship:** Enhancement layer adding robustness and performance to core extraction

## Description

Implement directory scanning and file identification logic for Cursor chat logs within workspace directories.

## Details

- Create `find_cursor_chats()` function to locate chat files in workspace
- Implement directory traversal with configurable depth limits
- Add file pattern matching to identify Cursor chat log files
- Support multiple workspace storage locations (platform-specific paths)
- Create file validation to ensure discovered files are valid chat logs
- Implement filtering by date range or file size if needed
- Add caching mechanism for discovered file paths
- Support exclusion patterns for directories to skip
- Handle symbolic links and circular references safely

## Test Strategy

- Test file discovery on sample Cursor workspace with known chat files
- Verify depth limiting prevents excessive directory traversal
- Test pattern matching correctly identifies chat files vs other JSON files
- Confirm platform-specific paths work on different operating systems
- Validate exclusion patterns skip specified directories
- Test symbolic link handling doesn't cause infinite loops
- Verify caching improves performance on repeated scans

## Follow-up Context

**Parent Task:** Task 2 - Chat Extraction Engine
**Trigger:** Task expansion for better manageability
**Relationship:** First step in the extraction pipeline - finding the files to extract

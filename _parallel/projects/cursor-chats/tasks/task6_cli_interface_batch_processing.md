## Description

Build command-line interface with batch processing capabilities for efficient chat extraction and journal generation workflows. This is a parent task that has been expanded into sub-tasks for better manageability.

## Details

**This task has been expanded into sub-tasks:**

- task6.1_core_cli_framework.md
- task6.2_individual_commands_implementation.md
- task6.3_batch_processing_advanced_features.md

Original scope included:

- Implement main CLI interface in `cli.py` using argparse or click
- Add commands: `extract`, `parse`, `journal`, `tag`, `batch`
- Support batch processing with `--all` flag for multiple file operations
- Implement configurable logging with verbosity levels (--quiet, --verbose, --debug)
- Add progress bars and status indicators for long-running operations
- Create configuration file support for default settings and preferences
- Implement dry-run mode for safe operation testing
- Add comprehensive help documentation and usage examples
- Support glob patterns and recursive directory processing
- Create command chaining and pipeline operations

## Test Strategy

The test strategy has been distributed across the sub-tasks to ensure comprehensive coverage of all CLI functionality.

## Agent Notes

**Task Expanded: 2025-06-07T23:49:29Z**
This task was identified as too complex due to multiple distinct components and has been broken down into three logical sub-tasks:

1. Core CLI framework setup
2. Individual command implementations
3. Advanced features including batch processing and configuration

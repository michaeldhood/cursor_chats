## Description

Create dependency graphs and knowledge maps for chat relationships to visualize conversation flow and knowledge connections.

## Details

- Implement conversation dependency graph generation using Graphviz or similar
- Create knowledge maps showing topic relationships and evolution
- Add interactive timeline visualizations with zoom and filtering
- Implement conversation flow diagrams for complex decision threads
- Create tag relationship networks showing concept connections
- Add project evolution visualizations with milestone tracking
- Implement custom visualization themes and styling options
- Create export capabilities for presentations and reports
- Add interactive features for exploration and navigation
- Support multiple output formats (SVG, PNG, HTML, interactive web)

## Test Strategy

- Test dependency graph generation creates accurate relationship visualizations
- Verify knowledge maps show meaningful topic connections
- Test interactive timeline features work smoothly with large datasets
- Confirm conversation flow diagrams capture decision logic correctly
- Validate tag networks display concept relationships clearly
- Test project evolution visualizations show progress accurately
- Verify custom themes produce visually appealing outputs
- Test export capabilities maintain quality across formats
- Confirm interactive features enhance exploration without performance issues
- Validate multiple output formats work correctly for different use cases

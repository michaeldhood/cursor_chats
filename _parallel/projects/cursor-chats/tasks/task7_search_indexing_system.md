## Description

Implement chat indexing and keyword search functionality for finding relevant conversations across project archives.

## Details

- Create search index using SQLite for efficient keyword queries
- Implement full-text search across chat messages and metadata
- Add search result ranking based on relevance and recency
- Support filtering by date ranges, tags, and project context
- Create incremental indexing for newly processed chats
- Implement search query preprocessing and normalization
- Add boolean search operators (AND, OR, NOT) and phrase matching
- Support fuzzy matching for typos and variations
- Create cross-project search capabilities with project isolation
- Add search result highlighting and snippet extraction

## Test Strategy

- Test index creation and updates with sample chat datasets
- Verify keyword search returns relevant and ranked results
- Test filtering functionality across various criteria (date, tags, project)
- Confirm incremental indexing adds new chats without full rebuild
- Validate boolean search operators work correctly
- Test fuzzy matching handles common typos and variations
- Verify cross-project search respects project boundaries
- Test search performance with large datasets (>1000 chats)

## Description

Implement manual and regex-based tagging for organizing extracted chats by topic, technology, and context.

## Details

- Create tagging framework in `parser.py` with extensible tag types
- Implement regex-based automatic tagging for common patterns
- Add manual tagging interface for user-defined labels
- Support hierarchical tags (e.g., `technology/python`, `project/frontend`)
- Create tag suggestion system based on chat content analysis
- Implement tag persistence and retrieval from chat metadata
- Add tag validation and normalization (lowercase, standardized format)
- Support bulk tagging operations for multiple chats
- Create tag management functions (create, update, delete, merge)
- Add tag-based filtering and organization capabilities

## Test Strategy

- Test automatic tagging accuracy on sample chat conversations
- Verify manual tagging persists correctly in metadata
- Test hierarchical tag structure and validation
- Confirm tag suggestion system provides relevant recommendations
- Validate bulk tagging operations work efficiently
- Test tag filtering and search functionality
- Verify tag normalization produces consistent results

## Description

Implement core functionality to extract Cursor chat logs from workspace directories with customizable paths and performance optimization. This is a parent task that has been expanded into sub-tasks for better manageability.

## Details

**This task has been expanded into sub-tasks:**

- task2.1_cursor_chat_file_discovery.md
- task2.2_extraction_core_logic.md
- task2.3_performance_error_handling.md

Original scope included:

- Implement `extract_chats()` function in `extractor.py`
- Add workspace directory scanning with configurable depth limits
- Support customizable output paths and filenames for extracted JSON files
- Handle large directory structures with performance optimization
- Implement file filtering to identify valid Cursor chat log files
- Add progress indicators for extraction operations
- Create error handling for file access permissions and corrupted files
- Support batch extraction with configurable output organization
- Add validation for extracted chat file format and structure

## Test Strategy

The test strategy has been distributed across the sub-tasks to ensure comprehensive coverage of all extraction functionality.

## Agent Notes

**Task Expanded: 2025-06-07T23:49:29Z**
This task was identified as too complex for a single implementation and has been broken down into three logical sub-tasks:

1. File discovery and identification
2. Core extraction logic
3. Performance optimization and error handling

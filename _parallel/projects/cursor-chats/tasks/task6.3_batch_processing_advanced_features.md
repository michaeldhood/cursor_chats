## Description

Add batch operations, configuration files, logging, and progress indicators to enhance CLI usability.

## Details

- Implement `batch` command for processing multiple files
- Add `--all` flag support across relevant commands
- Create configuration file system (YAML/TOML) for defaults
- Implement logging system with configurable verbosity levels
- Add progress bars for long-running operations
- Create dry-run mode for safe operation preview
- Implement glob pattern support for file selection
- Add recursive directory processing capabilities
- Create advanced command chaining and pipelines
- Implement operation history and undo capabilities

## Test Strategy

- Test batch processing handles multiple files correctly
- Verify configuration files override defaults appropriately
- Test logging levels produce expected output detail
- Confirm progress bars accurately reflect operation status
- Validate dry-run mode shows operations without executing
- Test glob patterns match files correctly
- Verify recursive processing traverses directories properly
- Test command pipelines produce correct combined results

## Follow-up Context

**Parent Task:** Task 6 - CLI Interface & Batch Processing
**Trigger:** Task expansion for better manageability
**Relationship:** Advanced features that enhance the CLI's power and usability

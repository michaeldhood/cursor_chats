## Description

Create memory bank for key excerpts with Cursor Rules export capability to provide durable context for future AI sessions.

## Details

- Implement `extract_memories()` function to identify key conversation excerpts
- Create memory categorization system (decisions, solutions, patterns, learnings)
- Add manual memory curation interface for user-selected important content
- Implement automatic memory scoring based on context importance
- Create memory deduplication to avoid storing redundant information
- Add memory organization by topic, project, and time period
- Implement Cursor Rules export format for seamless integration
- Create memory search and retrieval functionality
- Add memory aging and archival policies for relevance management
- Support memory sharing and collaboration features

## Test Strategy

- Test automatic memory extraction identifies relevant content accurately
- Verify memory categorization produces meaningful organization
- Test manual curation interface allows proper memory selection
- Confirm memory scoring ranks importance appropriately
- Validate deduplication prevents redundant memory storage
- Test Cursor Rules export format integrates correctly with Cursor
- Verify memory search returns relevant results quickly
- Test memory aging and archival maintains system performance

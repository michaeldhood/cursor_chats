## Description

Build chronological timeline view of project conversations to track evolution and decision points over time.

## Details

- Implement `generate_timeline()` function to create chronological chat sequences
- Add timeline visualization with key milestones and decision points
- Support timeline filtering by project, topic, or date range
- Create timeline aggregation for daily, weekly, or monthly views
- Implement timeline annotation with manual milestone markers
- Add timeline export in multiple formats (HTML, Markdown, JSON)
- Create timeline linking to connect related conversations
- Support timeline customization with user-defined event types
- Implement timeline comparison between different projects or periods
- Add timeline search within specific time ranges

## Test Strategy

- Test timeline generation creates accurate chronological sequences
- Verify timeline visualization displays milestones and decisions clearly
- Test filtering produces appropriate timeline subsets
- Confirm timeline aggregation summarizes periods effectively
- Validate manual annotations integrate properly into timelines
- Test timeline exports maintain formatting and functionality
- Verify timeline linking connects related conversations correctly
- Test timeline comparison shows meaningful differences
- Confirm timeline search finds events within specified ranges

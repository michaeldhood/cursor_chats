## Description

Integrate AI APIs for automated summarization and insight extraction to enhance chat analysis capabilities.

## Details

- Research and select suitable AI APIs (xAI, OpenAI, Anthropic) for summarization
- Implement API integration framework with configurable providers
- Create automated chat summarization with configurable length and focus
- Add insight extraction for identifying key decisions and patterns
- Implement cost management and rate limiting for API usage
- Create fallback mechanisms for API failures or unavailability
- Add local model support as alternative to cloud APIs
- Implement batch processing for efficient API usage
- Create summary quality assessment and validation
- Add user feedback integration for improving summarization accuracy

## Test Strategy

- Test API integration with multiple providers (xAI, OpenAI, etc.)
- Verify summarization produces accurate and useful summaries
- Test insight extraction identifies relevant decisions and patterns
- Confirm cost management prevents unexpected charges
- Validate rate limiting prevents API quota violations
- Test fallback mechanisms handle API failures gracefully
- Verify local model integration works as cloud alternative
- Test batch processing optimizes API usage efficiently
- Confirm quality assessment identifies poor summaries
- Validate user feedback improves summarization over time

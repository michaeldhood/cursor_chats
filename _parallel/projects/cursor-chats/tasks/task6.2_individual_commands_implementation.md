## Description

Implement extract, parse, journal, tag commands with basic functionality connecting to core modules.

## Details

- Implement `extract` command connecting to extraction engine
- Create `parse` command for JSON parsing operations
- Build `journal` command for journal generation workflows
- Add `tag` command for tagging operations on chats
- Implement command-specific options and arguments
- Create command help text and usage examples
- Add input/output file handling for each command
- Implement command-specific validation logic
- Create success/failure feedback for each operation
- Add basic command chaining support

## Test Strategy

- Test each command executes its core functionality correctly
- Verify command-specific options work as documented
- Test file input/output handling for various scenarios
- Confirm validation catches invalid inputs appropriately
- Validate success/failure feedback is clear and actionable
- Test basic command chaining produces expected results
- Verify help text is accurate and helpful for each command

## Follow-up Context

**Parent Task:** Task 6 - CLI Interface & Batch Processing
**Trigger:** Task expansion for better manageability
**Relationship:** Implementation of individual CLI commands using the framework

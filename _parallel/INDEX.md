## About Task Magic

Task Magic is a file-based project management system that helps you organize software projects by defining plans, breaking them down into actionable tasks, and maintaining memory of completed work. It's designed to work seamlessly with AI agents like Cursor to avoid the "AI loop of death" by providing clear context and structured workflows.
